## INHERITANCE
Inheritance in Java is a powerful object-oriented concept that allows one class to acquire the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another. It helps achieve code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

Let’s break down the types:

1. Single-Level Inheritance
This is the simplest form. One class inherits from another.

2. Multi-Level Inheritance
A class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance
Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.

4. Hybrid Inheritance (Conceptual only in Java)
This is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. Java doesn’t support hybrid inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity (the diamond problem), but it can be achieved through interfaces.

## INTERFACE 
In Java, an interface is like a contract or blueprint for a class. It defines what a class should do, but not how it does it.

Here's the breakdown:
1. It contains method signatures (without bodies) that any implementing class must provide.

2. A class uses the implements keyword to agree to follow the rules of the interface.

3. Interfaces help achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

---> Java also allows interfaces to contain default methods (with body) and static methods
