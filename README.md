## INHERITANCE

Inheritance in Java is a powerful object-oriented concept that allows one class to acquire the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another. It helps achieve code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

Let’s break down the types:

1. Single-Level Inheritance
   This is the simplest form. One class inherits from another.

2. Multi-Level Inheritance
   A class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance
   Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.

4. Hybrid Inheritance (Conceptual only in Java)
   This is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. Java doesn’t support hybrid inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity (the diamond problem), but it can be achieved through interfaces.

## INTERFACE

In Java, an interface is like a contract or blueprint for a class. It defines what a class should do, but not how it does it.

Here's the breakdown:

1. It contains method signatures (without bodies) that any implementing class must provide.

2. A class uses the implements keyword to agree to follow the rules of the interface.

3. Interfaces help achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

---> Java also allows interfaces to contain default methods (with body) and static methods

## POLYMORPHISM

### 🌟 Fundamental Concepts

    -> Definition of Polymorphism – What it is and why it matters in OOP.
        ANS. Polymorphism in Java refers to the ability of a single entity—like a method or object—to   take on many forms. In object-oriented programming, it allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.

        In simple terms:
        Polymorphism lets you call the same method on different objects, and each object can respond in its own way.

        For example, if you have a superclass called Animal with a method makeSound(), each subclass (like Dog, Cat, or Cow) can override this method to make its own sound. When you call makeSound() on an Animal reference, the correct version runs depending on the actual object type. This is runtime polymorphism.

        If you’d like, I can whip up a code example to help illustrate this!
    -> Types of Polymorphism – Compile-time (static) vs Runtime (dynamic) polymorphism.

### 🛠 Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

    -> Method overloading rules
        .Same Method Name, Different Parameters: The overloaded methods must differ in either:
        .Number of parameters
        .Type of parameters
        .Order of parameters (if types are different)
        .Return Type Doesn’t Matter Alone: Changing only the return type won’t differentiate methods.
        .Access Modifiers & Exceptions Don’t Count: You can vary access modifiers and exception lists, but they don't influence overloading resolution.

    -> Constructor overloading
        .Just like methods, constructors can be overloaded:
        .Same class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
        .This allows creating objects in multiple ways.

    -> How the compiler chooses the correct method
        .At compile time, Java uses method signature and the types of arguments passed to determine the best match. It considers:
        .Exact match first
        .Widening (e.g., int → long)
        .Autoboxing (e.g., int → Integer)
        .Varargs (last resort)
